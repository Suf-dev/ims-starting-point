# Project Title

This project is based on an inventory management system which allows the user to interact with a MySql database performing CRUD operations thereafter testing the application using JUnit test cases.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
#
A laptop with bare minimum of 8gb RAM would be sufficient and preferably upto date. As for software, Java 8 or later should be installed along with a suitable IDE, for my peronal development for example I have chosen to use the eclipse IDE.



### Installing

The ims folder can be found on Github the following steps should be followed:
1. fork/clone this repository into a folder on your PC
2. import the project into a workspace in IDE of your choice
3. you can then open the ims project and start running 
4. connection to the specific GCP instance is also required in order to run the project
5. The next step would be to create a GCP instance to view background activity on the database




## Running the tests

To test my application I have been focused on Unit and integration testing by using the JUnit framework for testing the each unit of code



### And coding style tests

For the focus of my project I have been focused on using a specific design pattern known as the 'Single responsibilty' design pattern which means a class is only responsible for implementing one set function, the reason for this would be to simply code and cause less confusion to the reader.
